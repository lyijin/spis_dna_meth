======================================
GLM for differential genic methylation
======================================

The GLM R script ``GLM_reinvented_wheel.R`` requires the file ``compiled_meth_unmeth_gene_treatment.genic.tsv``, which is a file (738 M) that is too big to be uploaded.

This file was generated using the Python script found in the same folder, ``compile_covs_for_glm.py``. If you want to regenerate that large file, modify the script to point to the decompressed cov files (found at ``../``).

If you wanna skip the hassle, the results of this R script is provided in the ``*.tsv`` files in this folder.

The script has been modified by me--details are provided in the script itself.
