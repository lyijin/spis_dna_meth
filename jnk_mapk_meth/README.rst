JNK, MAPK analysis
==================

``spis.bias_density_methylation.xlsx`` was compiled from information produced by ``../bias_density_medians``.

``reinv.7.2v8.1.5cpg.0.05.txt`` lists the significantly differentially methylated genes at pH 7.2, produced by ``../GLM``.

With these input files, the plotter script ``plot_median_meth_timeseries.py`` creates the pdf output in this folder.
